This Privacy Policy explains what information Strongr Fastr, LLC and its affiliates (collectively, “Strongr Fastr” or “We”) collect, how information is collected, how we use that information, what information is shared with whom, and how Strongr Fastr protects your information when you use our products and services (“Services”).</p>

<ol ><b><h2 dir="ltr"  role="presentation"><li>When This Privacy Policy Applies </li></h2></b></ol>

<ol  start="6"><h2><b><li>What Information We share.</li></b></h2>

</ol><p>We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties and the information disclosed is the minimum amount necessary to fulfill the legitimate business purpose. We do not share Personal Information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Strongr Fastr except in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>With Your Consent.</b> We may share your Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Strongr Fastr when we have your consent to do so.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>Third-Party Service Providers.</b> We may disclose your Personal Information to our third-party service providers who perform various functions on our behalf, but Strongr Fastr requires these third parties to agree in writing to safeguard your Personal Information appropriately and in accordance with the law. </p>

</li>
<li><p><b>For External Services.</b> We may, from time to time, outsource some or all of the operations of our business to third-party service providers. In such cases, it may be necessary for us to disclose your information to those service providers. In some cases, the service providers may collect information directly from you on our behalf. We restrict how such service providers may access, use and disclose your information. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. These agents may have access to your information as needed to perform their functions, but they are not permitted to use it for other purposes.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>For Legal Reasons.</b> We may disclose any information about you when, in our opinion, such disclosure is necessary to prevent fraud or to comply with any statute, law, rule or regulation of any governmental authority or any order of any court of competent jurisdiction. We will share Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Strongr Fastr if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: enforce applicable terms of use/service, including investigation of potential violations; detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Strongr Fastr, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>In a Transaction.</b> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell, buy or merge with companies, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, data generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy statement/policy (unless, of course, the person consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Strongr Fastr or all of its assets is acquired, your information may be one of the transferred assets.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>After Being Fully Deidentified, Incapable of Reidentification.</b> We may share aggregated, de-identified information publicly and with our partners to evaluate the effectiveness, value, and analytic trends of the Services.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<ol  start="7"><h2><b><li>How We Protect Your information</li></b></h2>

</ol><p>We take steps to secure Personal Information through administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect against the risk of accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted through the Internet, and where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.</p>

<ol  start="8"><h2><b><li>Transparency, Privacy Rights and Choices, and Account Termination</li></b></h2>

</ol><h1 dir="ltr" >Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. Subject to your specific use of the Services, your privacy rights include:</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Transparency and the right to information.</b> Through this policy we explain how we use and share your information. However, if you have questions or need additional information you can contact us any time at [Insert Email]. </p>

</li>
<li><p><b>Right of access, restriction of processing, erasure.</b> You may contact us to request information about the Personal Information we have collected from you, or to request that your Personal Information be deleted. We will do our best to honor your requests, subject to any legal, ethical and contractual obligations. To make a request or to ask us a question about our data practices, please contact us via email at: [Insert Email]. When requesting access to your Personal Information, please note that we may request specific information from you to enable us to confirm your identity and right to access, as well as to search for and provide you with the Personal Information that we hold about you. You may designate an authorized agent to request information on your behalf, provided that the authorized agent complies with our verification procedures to ensure your permission has been obtained.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>Your right to access or delete the Personal Information we hold about you is not absolute.</b> There are instances where applicable law or regulatory requirements allow or require us to refrain from taking certain actions with respect to some or all of the Personal Information that we hold about you. In addition, some or all of the Personal Information may have been destroyed, erased or made anonymous. In the event we cannot provide you with access to your Personal Information, or we are unable to delete it, we will inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>Right to correct your information.</b> We endeavor to ensure that Personal Information in our possession is accurate, current and complete. If an individual believes that the Personal Information about him or her is incorrect, incomplete or outdated, he or she may request the revision or correction of that information. We reserve the right not to change any Personal Information we consider accurate. If it is determined that Personal Information is inaccurate, incomplete or outdated, we will use reasonable efforts to revise it and, if necessary, use reasonable efforts to inform agents, service providers or other third parties, which were provided with inaccurate information, so records in their possession may be corrected or updated.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>Right to withdraw your consent at any time.</b> When we process your Personal Information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This includes consents regarding your participation in certain Services, email/text/other communication consents, or any other consent that you have provided to Strongr Fastr. You may withdraw your consent by contacting us at: [Insert Email]. Withdrawing consents may significantly limit your ability to use the Services.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>Right to object or opt-out at any time.</b> You have the right to object at any time to receiving marketing or promotional materials from us by either following the opt-out instructions in commercial e-mails or by contacting us, as well as the right to object to any processing of your Personal Information or to participating in any program. We will consider any request you make to us, and provide a reply in a timely manner, according to our legal, ethical and contractual obligations. Some non-marketing communications are not subject to a general right to opt-out, such as communications about transactions and disclosures to comply with legal or ethical requirements.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Right to data portability.</b> You have the right to data portability of your own personal data by contacting us. There are instances where applicable law or regulatory requirements allow or require us to refrain from transmitting your Personal Information to certain recipients or may require additional documentation before transmitting your information. In addition, some or all of the Personal Information may have been destroyed, erased or made anonymous. In the event we cannot fulfill your data portability request or require additional information to do so, we will contact you.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<ol  start="9"><h2><b><li>Terminating Your account</li></b></h2>

</ol><p>You may terminate your account with us at any time through the account settings or emailing privacy@strongrfastr.com. Terminating your account will revoke any applicable consents or opt-ins but will be subject to any data retention requirements as described below.</p>

<ol  start="10"><h2><b><li>Retention of Collected information</li></b></h2>

</ol><p>Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements, we will retain your Personal Information only for as long as we believe it is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Information was collected (including for the purpose of meeting any legal, accounting or other reporting requirements or obligations). You may request that we delete the Personal Information about you that we hold, as described above.</p>

<ol  start="11"><h2><b><li>Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information</li></b></h2>

</ol><p>Whenever you use our Services, we aim to provide you with access to your Personal Information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your Personal Information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request. Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our Services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our Services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made by contacting privacy@strongrfastr.com.</p>

<ol  start="12"><h2><b><li>Information on children</li></b></h2>

</ol><p>The Services are not directed to or intended for use by minors. In compliance with laws, we will not intentionally collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If we learn we have collected or received Personal Information from a child under 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete it. If you are the parent or guardian of a child under 18 years of age whom you believe might have provided us with their Personal Information, please contact us to request that it be deleted.</p>

<ol  start="13"><h2><b><li>Compliance and Cooperation with Regulatory Authorities</li></b></h2>

</ol><p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. If we receive a formal written complaint, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of Personal Information that we cannot resolve with our users directly.</p>

<ol  start="14"><h2><b><li>Changes to this Privacy Policy</li></b></h2>

</ol><p>This Privacy Policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party. If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are material, we will provide a more prominent notice by sending you an email and/or posting a notice in the Services. Strongr Fastr reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently.</p>
